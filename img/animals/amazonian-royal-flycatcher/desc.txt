The Amazonian royal flycatcher (Onychorhynchus coronatus coronatus) is a passerine bird of the tyrant flycatcher family. Depending on authority, it is often considered the nominate subspecies of the single widespread royal flycatcher, or considered a species closely related to three other royal flycatchers, the northern royal flycatcher, the Pacific royal flycatcher, and the Atlantic royal flycatcher.

The Amazonian royal flycatcher is found in forest and woodland throughout most of the Amazon basin in northern Bolivia, eastern Peru, eastern Ecuador, eastern Colombia, Venezuela, the Guianas, and northern and western Brazil. It is easily overlooked and typically found in low densities, but overall it remains widespread and common. It is therefore considered to be of least concern by BirdLife International.

The Amazonian royal flycatchers are about 6 1/2 inches in length and like to dart out from branches to catch flying insects or pluck them from leaves. They build very large nests (sometimes up to 6 feet long) on branches near water. The nest hangs over the water which makes it hard for predators to reach.
